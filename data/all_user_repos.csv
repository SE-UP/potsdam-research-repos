https://github.com/aipescience/AsciiIngest;A general ASCII file row based ingestion tool using the DBIngestor library. This tool allows you to define custom ASCII data formats similar to the  MS SQL Server format files. However it is possible to define custom checks, transformation functions, derived data rows, and constant data rows. It is  easy to extend the assertion and convertion functions, by implementing ones  own functions in the DBIngestor library. Further the DBIngestor library provided data buffering for higher ingest performance and many interfaces to various DB systems.;no_research;C++

https://github.com/aipescience/DBIngestor;This library provides wrappers to data ingestion into various DB systems, such as MySQL, SQLite3, and ODBC compatible systems. You can use this C++ library to ingest data in any format (you need to implement the reading routines though). The library provides an ingestion buffer that allows for multiple rows to be ingested at one time. This greatly improves ingestion performance. Further assertion and conversion functions are provided for elementary data transformation and processing. These can easily be extended by custom functions and many examples for implementing such functions are provided in the source.;no_research;C++

https://github.com/damariszurell/IBM_OptimalForaging;C++ source code for the individual-based model of optimal foraging in white storks introduced in Zurell et al. (2015) Oikos. The model predicts the spatial structure and breeding success of white stork populations in heterogeneous landscapes by explicitly simulating foraging behaviour and home range formation of individuals competing for resources. Because resource depletion is modelled explicitly, the model can predict the maximum carrying capacity of white stork breeding populations in different landscapes, and density-dependent breeding success by inducing fixed stork density levels below carrying capacity. Different behavioural options for the optimal foraging routine and the home range optimisation can be made, and the model also allows tracking individual movement paths. Please note that the code is not optimised for custom use. For any questions, please feel free to contact me via email.;no_research;C++

https://github.com/damariszurell/Rcodes_MapNovelEnvironments_SDMs;Inflated response curves and environmental overlap masks for species distribution models SDMs (R codes). Here you can download the R codes for inflated SDM response curves and environmental overlap masks introduced in Zurell et al. (2012) DDI. These simple functions facilitate visualisation of multi-dimensional SDM response and of model extrapolations to novel (=unsampled) environments.  Inflated response curves are an extension of conventional partial dependence plots that show the effects of one variable on the response while accounting not only for the average effects of all other variables but also for minimum and maximum (and median and quartile) values. Thus, they are basically an abstracted 2D version of the multidimensional response surfaces. Their advantages are that (1) they are explicit about the shape of the response at different values of all other variables, and (2) make the responses clear if interactions are (implicitly or explicitly) included in SDMs.  Environmental overlap masks compare two datasets (sampled data and prediction data, e.g. climate change scenario or different geographical area) and identify novel environments, meaning both environmental conditions beyond the sampled ranges of the single variables and novel combinations of environmental variables. ;no_research;R
