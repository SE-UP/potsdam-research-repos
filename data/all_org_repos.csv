https://github.com/aipescience/DBIngestor;This library provides wrappers to data ingestion into various DB systems, such as MySQL, SQLite3, and ODBC compatible systems. You can use this C++ library to ingest data in any format (you need to implement the reading routines though). The library provides an ingestion buffer that allows for multiple rows to be ingested at one time. This greatly improves ingestion performance. Further assertion and conversion functions are provided for elementary data transformation and processing. These can easily be extended by custom functions and many examples for implementing such functions are provided in the source.;no_research;C++;leibniz;aip_e-science
https://github.com/aipescience/AsciiIngest;A general ASCII file row based ingestion tool using the DBIngestor library. This tool allows you to define custom ASCII data formats similar to the  MS SQL Server format files. However it is possible to define custom checks, transformation functions, derived data rows, and constant data rows. It is  easy to extend the assertion and convertion functions, by implementing ones  own functions in the DBIngestor library. Further the DBIngestor library provided data buffering for higher ingest performance and many interfaces to various DB systems.;no_research;C++;leibniz;aip_e-science
